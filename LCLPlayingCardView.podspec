                   LCLPlayingCardView is a simple, but beautiful playing card implemented as a UIView.
                   
                   Lightweight: No images for the cards -- 100% code.
                   Flexible: Since itâ€™s code, you can tweak anything about the cards to fit your needs.
                   Realistic Feel: The included customizations make the cards feel more real
